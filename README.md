The flanker task is an inhibition control task developed by Eriksen & Eriksen (1974). It measures
the ability to selectively attend to and respond to relevant stimuli while inhibiting responding to
irrelevant/distracting stimuli (Eriksen & Eriksen, 1974). In the task, the target is
flanked/surrounded by distractor/non-target stimulus in either the same direction (congruent) or
opposite direction of the target (incongruent) or to neither (neutral) direction. The position of the
target is in the center of the stimulus. The rationale behind the task is that incongruent trials
require inhibitory control requiring the participants to adjust their response when the target
and/or flankers suddenly change direction. The task’s goal is to measure/observe this inhibition
control (Geest & Engelbregt, 2022). For the flanking effect to occur, the participants must fixate
their gaze on the center of a screen (indicated by a fixation point). Then they are asked to press
the indicated keys according to the target’s direction. The hypothesis is that when we need to
respond to a stimulus that is surrounded by distractors, the distractors will affect our response. In
other words, our responses for the target surrounded by irrelevant stimuli would be slower
compared to relevant or no distractors. The flanker effect allows the study of the interference
effect from irrelevant stimuli. Classic flanker tasks test the effect either using arrow shapes or
letters. However, the present experiment aims to test the same using different shapes (squares
and triangles).
There are three types of stimuli/flanker types (Eriksen & Eriksen, 1974). For the present
experiment, the presentation of the triangle is to be indicated by pressing the ‘A’ key, and the
presentation of squares is to be indicated by pressing the ‘L’ key:
1. Congruent: In this type, the stimulus is surrounded by the same shape or same direction
i.e. the non-target and target stimuli are the same. (for the presented example, pressing
‘A’ would be the correct response)
2. Incongruent: In this type, the stimulus is surrounded by different shapes or opposite
directions i.e. the non-target and target stimuli are different.(for the presented example,
pressing ‘L’ would be the correct response)
3. Neutral: In this type, the stimulus has neither the same shape or direction of the target
stimulus. (for the presented example, pressing ‘A’ would be the correct response)
